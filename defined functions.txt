# 1- Create a function that calculates the area of ​​a circle given its radius..

def calculate_circle_area(radio):
    area = 3.14159 * (radio ** 2)
    return area

area = calculate_circle_area(5)
print(area)

# 2- Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest number in the list.

def find_largest_number(numbers):
    largest = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers:
        if number > largest:
            largest = number
    return largest

# Verify that the code runs

numbers = [10, 5, 20, 3, 15]
largest = find_largest_number(numbers)
print(largest)


# 3- Create a function that calculates the distance between two points on a Cartesian plane.
